# Internet-Provideer-Grid
A 1D grid is used to simulate people living in a neighborhood and using internet. Certain neighbors cause special effects on the internet such as outages. 
These effects cause neighbors to move around due to internet outages and over usage.

This program runs in Eclipse IDE.
